DETAILED PROBLEM DESCEIPTION

Design a system that:-


-Records student profiles (roll_no, name, course_list, grades[]).

-Allows adding/dropping courses and entering grades. 

-Computes GPA using weighted averages. 

-Uses arrays for course storage, structures for students, and functions for GPA calculation. 

-Employ pointers for dynamic course list and file I/O for saving records. 








DEVELOPMENT STEPS:


1. Planned the Project:-

   Decided to make a simple course enrollment system where a student can add courses,drop courses,enter grades and get a gpa.


2. Created the structures

  Made two structs:

  -Course for storing course name, credits, and grade

  -Student for storing student details and an array of courses


  3. Built the main features:

     -function to add a course.

     -function to drop a course.

     -function to enter grades.

     -function to calculate gpa.


   4. Added a menu system
      
      Used a while loop with options so the user can choose what action to do.


   5. Tested the program

      Tried adding or removing courses,entering grades and checking if gpa calculation works properly.
